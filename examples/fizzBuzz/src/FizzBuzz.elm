-- Import Html module exposing to this context all functions inside that module
-- this means, we can call its functions without having to prepend the name of the module
-- so we can call [text](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/html/2.0.0/Html#text)
-- just using the name function 'text' instead of 'Html.text'

-- Now we are importing List an String modules. In this case we are not exposing

-- Under this lines we are defining our fizzbuzz function. The first line is
-- the function type annotation, it is telling that our function is going to

-- This will help us know how the function works, and also will help to the elm
-- compiler to raise errors if we are calling or returning other types when we
-- are using that function.
